Dependencies
------------

- Python 2
- Django 1.8
- oauth2client
- django-bootstrap3

Installation and configuration
------------------------------

Install all of the dependencies.

drchrono Birthday is distributed as a Django app, which is installed as follows:

1. Copy the `drchrono_birthday` directory to your project.
2. Enable the app in your project's `settings.py`, along with `bootstrap3`
   (django-bootstrap3):

        INSTALLED_APPS = (
            # ...
            'drchrono_birthday',
            'bootstrap3',
        )

3. Configure the app in your project's `urls.py`, with the namespace
   `drchrono_birthday`:

        urlpatterns = [
            # ...
            url(r'^birthday/', include('drchrono_birthday.urls',
                                       namespace="drchrono_birthday")),
        ]

4. drchrono Birthday lets the project handle user authentication.  See Django's
   documentation on `login_required()`.
5. Set up your drchrono API key and OAuth client secrets file.  Refer to
   drchrono for information obtaining the API key.  The client secrets file
   format:

        {
            "web": {
                "client_id": "drchrono client ID",
                "client_secret": "drchrono client secret",
                "redirect_uris": ["http://your-site.example.com/birthday/auth_return/"],
                "auth_uri": "https://drchrono.com/o/authorize/",
                "token_uri": "https://drchrono.com/o/token/"
            }
        }

    Put this file somewhere and configure drchrono Birthday with the path in
    your project's `settings.py`:

        DRCHRONO_BIRTHDAY_SECRETS = "/opt/drchrono-birthday/client_secrets.json"

6. Configure SMTP.  An example config is included (`config.ini`).  Edit it and
   save it somewhere to use in the next step.
7. Set up a cron job to run the custom command `python2 manage.py
   sendbirthdaymessages /opt/drchrono-birthday/config.ini` daily.

drchrono Birthday requires the default set of Django installed apps and
middleware and may not work if some of them are missing.

drchrono Birthday relies on Django's native authentication library.  User
authentication and/or registration should be handled by your project.

Sending emails
--------------

drchrono Birthday's custom `sendbirthdaymessages` command will send message for
all birthdays that have happened since the last time the command was run up to
and including the current day.  This "memory" is ignored on the first run (which
only sends messages for the current day) and is limited to one week in the past,
to prevent sending messages for extremely old birthdays.

The server should be up and configured to run this command daily; this "memory"
feature is to ameliorate small bugs in deployment.  It may be undesirable in
extreme edge cases, or when the timezone or system clock is experiencing
fluctuations; in such cases, use the admin interface to edit the database and
delete the `last_sent` key in the `Global` model.
